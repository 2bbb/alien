		<p>
			ALiEn is a GPU-accelerated physics engine with focus on artificial life computations.
			It provides an abstraction of a physical world in 2D and offers the capability to programm matter building blocks.
			Each simulated machine (named cell cluster) has an internal structure of building blocks (named cells) modeled and visualized as a graph.
			They can perform both physical actions and information processing by circulating tokens along the nodes.

		<p>
			The easiest way to get to know the ALiEn simulator is to load and run an existing example file.
			You find various demos in <i>examples/*</i> demonstrating capabilities of the engine ranging from physics
			examples, building machines, replicators to small ecosystems.
		</p>
		<p>
			To this end, go to <i>Simulation -> Load</i> and then on <i>Simulation -> Run</i> in the menu or use the toolbar.
			During running simulations you can get to know the navigation and monitoring functions:
			<ul>
			  <li>&#8226; zooming and visualization mode: <i>View -> Zoom in</i> as well as <i>View -> Zoom out</i></li>.
				after reaching a certain zoom level the view switches to edit mode.
			  <li>&#8226; toggle monitor: <i>View -> Monitor</i></li>
			</ul>
			By toggling again <i>Simulation -> Run</i> the simulation paused.
		</p>
		<p>
			Further useful computation functions:
			<ul>
			  <li>
				&#8226; snapshots: By clicking on <i>Simulation -> Snapshot</i> the current simulation state is saved in memory.
				You can continue running the simulation and return to the saved state by invoking <i>Simulation -> Restore</i>.
			  </li>
			  <li>
				&#8226; single step forward and backward: If a simulation is paused a single time step can be calculated via <i>Simulation -> Step forward</i>.
				The special thing about this feature is that the old state is saved and you can go back one time step by <i>Simulation -> Step backward</i>.
				This also works several times in a row.
			  </li>
			  <li>
				&#8226; display link: By disabling via <i>View -> Display link</i> one can disable rendering and thus accelerate the entire simulation.
			  </li>
			  <li>
				&#8226; accelerate active clusters: It is possible to assign active clusters (cell clusters with tokens) more computing power
				by periodically freezing the remaining content for certain amount of time steps. This can be achieved by toggling <i>Simulation -> Accelerate active clusters</i>.
			  </li>
		</p>
		<p>
			One of the most important manipulation functions are the simulation and computations parameters:
			<ul>
			  <li>&#8226; simulation parameters: 
			  <li>&#8226; computation parameters: 
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>
				Fun functions:
			</b>
			One feature that is a lot of fun is applying forces to bodies in a running simulation. During a simulation one can press hold the left mouse button and move the cursor
			in a certain direction. Forces are exerted on every body on the path.
			By pressing the right mouse button, only rotational forces are applied.
