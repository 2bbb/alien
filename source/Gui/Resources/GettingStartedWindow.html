		<p><h2>What is Articial Life Environment (ALiEn) ?</h2></p>
	</font>
	<font face="Courier" color="#000000" size="4">
		<p>
			ALiEn is an artificial life simulation program based on a specialized physics and rendering engine in CUDA.
			It provides an abstraction of a physical world in 2D and offers the capability to program matter building blocks.
			Each simulated machine (named <i>cell cluster</i>) has an internal structure of building blocks (named <i>cells</i>) modeled and visualized as a graph.
			They can perform both physical actions and information processing by circulating tokens along the nodes.

		<p><h2>First steps</h2></p>
	</font>
	<font face="Courier" color="#000000" size="4">
		<p>
			The easiest way to get to know the ALiEn simulator is to load and run an existing simulation file.
			You find various demos in <i>examples/simulations/*</i> demonstrating capabilities of the engine ranging from physics
			examples, building machines, replicators to small ecosystems. 
			To this end, go to <i>Simulation -> Load</i> and select a file.
			However, for starters, you can use the simple evolution example already loaded.
		</p>
		<p>
			Once the simulation is loaded, click <i>Simulation -> Run</i> from the menu or toolbar.
			During the running simulations you can get to know the following navigation and monitoring functions:
			<ul>
				<li>
					<b>zooming and visualization modes</b>: Zooming is done by clicking <i>View -> Zoom in</i> as well as <i>View -> Zoom out</i>.
					After reaching a certain zoom level, the view switches to the editor mode.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>toggling monitor</b>: <i>View -> Monitor</i>
				</li> 
			</ul>
			Clicking <i>Simulation -> Run</i> again pauses the simulation.
		</p>
		<p>
			Further useful computation functions:
			<ul>
			  <li>
				<b>snapshots</b>: Clicking <i>Simulation -> Snapshot</i> saves the current simulation state in memory.
				You can continue running the simulation and return to the saved state by invoking <i>Simulation -> Restore</i>.
			  </li>
			  <li>
				<b>single time step forward and backward</b>: If a simulation is paused, a single time step can be calculated via <i>Simulation -> Step forward</i>.
				The special feature of this function is that the old state is saved and one can go back one time step with <i>Simulation -> Step back</i>.
				This also works several times in a row.
			  </li>
			  <li>
				<b>display link</b>: By switching off <i>View -> Display link</i> you can disable the rendering and thus speed up the whole simulation.
			  </li>
			  <li>
				<b>accelerate active clusters</b>: It is possible to allocate more computing power to active clusters (cell clusters with tokens)
				by periodically freezing the remaining content for a certain number of time steps. This can be achieved by toggling <i>Simulation -> Accelerate active clusters</i>.
			  </li>
		</p>
		<p>
			One of the most important manipulation functions are the simulation and computations parameters:
			<ul>
				<li><b>simulation parameters</b>: The parameters can be set by opening the <i>Settings -> Simulation parameters</i> dialog. 
					Let us give some selected examples to play around with:
					<ul>
						<li>
							<b>cell properties -> max force</b>: Sets the threshold at which damage occurs. If you lower the value, the bodies can break more easily.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>cell properties -> fusion velocity</b>: Sets the threshold at which fusion occurs. If you lower the value, the bodies can fuse more easily.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>radiation -> factor</b>: Corresponds to the amount of energy that a cell emits from time to time. Higher values mean that the cells are destroyed more quickly.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>weapon -> energy cost</b>: Corresponds to the amount of energy a cell loses when it tries to attack its surroundings.
							Higher values make it more difficult for energy-consuming cell clusters to survive.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>cell function properties -> constructor -> * mutation probability</b>: Sets the different mutation rates. This is mainly relevant for replicator simulations.
						</li>
					</ul>
					An overview of all parameters can be found in <i>Help -> Documentation</i>.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>computation parameters</b>: The sizes of a simulation can be changed in <i>Settings -> Computation</i>. There are many more technical parameters that we can leave unchanged for now.
					They are used for the CUDA api and specify the number of threads and sizes of arrays.
					If <i>scale content</i> is enabled in the dialog, additional space created by a possible world
					enlargement will be periodically augmented with the existing cells and particles. 
				</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

			<b>Fun functions:</b>
			One feature that is a lot of fun is applying forces to bodies in a running simulation. During a simulation one can press hold the left mouse button and move the cursor
			in a certain direction. Forces are exerted on every body on its path.
			By pressing the right mouse button, only rotational forces are applied.

		<p><h2>Creating own simulations</h2></p>
	</font>
	<font face="Courier" color="#000000" size="4">
		<p>
			After you have learned the most important global functions, you can start to build your own world. We will show how to do this with an example:
			<br/>
			Create a new simulation by clicking on <i>Simulation -> New</i>. There you can choose the computation and simulation parameter settings. We may continue with the default values.
			Now we are able to add cell clusters. A primitive such as a hexagon can be added by <i>Collection -> New Hexagon</i>. After doing this, we can simply
			multiply the structure by invoking <i>Collection -> Random multiplier</i>. In the dialog that appears we can set random velocities for the copies. For example, a (angular) velocity range of -0.3 to 0.3
			could be chosen.
			In the next step, more clusters could be added. To do this, we scroll to a free position and add a saved collection with <i>Collection -> Load</i>.
			We select <i>examples/collections/spiral builder.aco</i> and multiply it again as described above.
			If you want to move certain cell clusters by hand, you can do it by dragging and dropping with the mouse pointer.
			<br/>
			When our construction is ready, we can take a snapshot (or save the simulation as a file) and run it to see the result.
			<br />

		<p>
			In order to assemble your own machines, you need a detailed knowledge of the cell functions and the information processing model described in <i>Help -> Documentation</i>.
			As a good starting point, one can load an example collection, e.g. <i>examples/collections/spiral builder.aco</i>, and study and manipulate it with the editor.
			The editor allows you to add, delete, rotate, and move cells as well as entire cell clusters using the mouse pointer and toolbar buttons.
			In addition, cells are equipped with functions. For example, a cell can be programmed with a <i>computer function</i> through a kind of machine language, or a <i>weapon function</i> can
			attack its environment to steal energy from possible other cells.
			The information about the type of cell function can be visualized by enabling <i>View -> Cell info</i>.
